Questions:
I.
A. What percentage of companies with a 6sense score (ss_score) of at least 85
and were added to the database (created) in January 2018 have been won
(became a 6sense customer)?

My answer:
-- Below query is in MySQL format:

SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN won = True THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(DISTINCT id) AS Percentage
FROM Company 
WHERE ss_score >= 85 AND DATE_FORMAT(create_dt, '%Y-%m-01') = '2018-01-01'



B. At the company level, what is the average number of contacts that were
interacted with before a successful (won) sale?

My answer:
-- Both MySQL and PostgreSQL should work for below query:

SELECT SUM(cnt) / COUNT(company_name) AS Average_contact_before_sale
FROM (
SELECT com.company_name, count(i.contact_id) AS cnt
FROM Interaction i
LEFT JOIN Contact con ON i.contact_id = con.id
LEFT JOIN Company com ON con.company_id = com.id 
WHERE i.interaction_dt < com.won_dt AND won = True
GROUP BY 1
) t



C. What is the interaction channel and the name of BOTH the Sales rep and
Customer Service rep who last interacted with the following companies:
XYZ inc., ABC co., 123 ltd.

Note: Sales reps interact with a company through the date of a sale,
while CS reps interact with a company after the date of sale.

Bonus (time permitting): See if you return the number of times those reps
have interacted with this company in the same query output.

My answer:
-- Since I will use window functions like row_number(), below query is in PostgreSQL 
-- (I did the bonus. The query is a little long but should work):

SELECT td.company_name,
td.interaction_channel,
td.sales_rep,
-- Bonus:
te.cnt AS Last_Sales_Rep_Contact_Times,
td.customer_service_rep,
-- Bonus: 
tf.cnt AS Last_Customer_Service_Rep_Contact_Times
FROM (
SELECT tb.company_name, tb.interaction_channel, 
tb.Sales_rep,
tc.Customer_Service_Rep
FROM 
-- Below sub-query selected the pre-sale last contacted sales representative of each company
(
SELECT ta.* 
FROM 
(
SELECT i2.contact_id, 
i2.rep_name AS Sales_rep,
i2.interaction_channel,
i2.interaction_dt,
com.id AS company_id,
com.company_name AS company_name,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY i2.contact_id ORDER BY i2.interaction_dt DESC) AS rn
FROM Interaction i2
LEFT JOIN Contact con ON i2.contact_id = con.id
LEFT JOIN Company com ON con.company_id = com.id 
WHERE i2.interaction_dt < com.won_dt
) ta
WHERE ta.rn = 1
) tb
LEFT JOIN 
-- Below sub-query selected the post-sale last contacted customer service representative of each company
(
SELECT com.id AS company_id, 
com.company_name AS company_name, 
i.interaction_channel, 
i.rep_name AS Customer_Service_Rep
FROM (
SELECT i1.* 
FROM 
(
SELECT contact_id, rep_name, 
interaction_channel,
interaction_dt,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY contact_id ORDER BY interaction_dt DESC) AS rn
FROM Interaction
) i1
WHERE i1.rn = 1
) i 
LEFT JOIN Contact con ON i.contact_id = con.id 
LEFT JOIN Company com ON con.company_id = com.id 
) tc
ON tb.company_id = tc.company_id 
WHERE tb.company_name LIKE '%XYZ inc.%' 
OR tb.company_name LIKE '%ABC co.%' 
OR tb.company_name LIKE '%123 ltd.%' 
) td
-- Calculate the number of times that sales representative contacted
LEFT JOIN (
SELECT com.company_name, rep_name, COUNT(ii.rep_name) AS cnt
FROM Interaction ii 
LEFT JOIN Contact con ON ii.contact_id = con.id 
LEFT JOIN Company com ON con.company_id = com.id 
GROUP BY 1,2
) te ON td.company_name = te.company_name 
AND td.Sales_rep = te.rep_name
-- Calculate the number of times that customer service representative contacted
LEFT JOIN (
SELECT com.company_name, rep_name, COUNT(ii.rep_name) AS cnt
FROM Interaction ii 
LEFT JOIN Contact con ON ii.contact_id = con.id 
LEFT JOIN Company com ON con.company_id = com.id 
GROUP BY 1,2
) tf ON td.company_name = tf.company_name 
AND td.customer_service_rep = tf.rep_name





QUESTION I end here.





II. The 6sense Marketing team is planning on running a campaign in which they
mail a promotional item to all prospects (individuals) that they met at a recent
event, with the goal that this mailer will lead to a sales call with the prospect.

The 6sense Data Science team has created a “Qualifying Model” that scores all
prospects (those met at previous events, those interacted with through other
channels, and those that have never been contacted) and assigns them a score
(1-100 scale) predicting the likelihood that a prospect, after receiving a
promotional item in the mail, will take a sales call. The Data Science team
suggests that Marketing should target any prospect with a score greater than 70.

How can the team test if targeting with the “Qualifying Model” score impacts
the success of the campaign? Explain how you would perform this test.

My answer:
This is a problem that can be solved by a case-control study. We can Separate our potential clients into two groups:

Group A: for clients who scored higher than 70, we send them promotional items.
Group B: the same number of clients as above scored lower than 70, and we also send them promotional items.

The result is a straightforward binary classification outcome for each group:
1. either the client answered the sales call 
2. or not answering the sales call.

Now we make a hypothesis:
H0 (Null hypothesis): p1 <= 0.05, the score is not statistically significant to the sales call.
H1 (or Ha Alternative hypothesis): p1 > 0.05, the score is statistically significant to the sales call.

Then we will collect data from our experiment like the sample average (Xbar) = (number of clients who took the sales call)/(sample size)
Sample standard deviation Var(Xbar) = p * (1-p)/(n-1). (p is the sample average and n is the sample size)
According to our hypothesis, the score should affect the outcome if the clients answered the sales call.

Then we can calculate the Z score: Z = Xbar - Miu / (standard deviation)  (Miu is the expected result we expected to clients scoring higher than 70 will answering our call)
Then we can calculate the corresponding P-value according to the standard normal distribution: Pr(observation|H0) = Pr(Z>=2.54) (98% probability)

If p-value < 0.05, that means our confidence interval is 95%. It means there is little probability observing clients answered sales call not related to the score.
Here, we reject the null hypothesis and we can accept the alternative hypothesis that the score is statistically significant to the sales call.

The next step is we do the above hypothesis and experiment for the clients who scored lower than 70 to see if they answered the sales call.
Now we have an experiment group and a control group. We calculate their p-value and variance = p*(1-p)/(n-1) 
Then we can calculate its Z score (p1 - p0)/sd = (p1 - p0) / (var(p1) + var(p0))

Finally, we can calculate its p-value through Z-score. if the p-value is greater than 0.05 then it means a 95% confidence interval.
We will accept the alternative hypothesis and reject the null hypothesis, which means the score is statistically significant to the sales call.





Please feel free to contact if you have any doubts or would like to discuss with me regarding above answers. I can provide more details. Thank you.
